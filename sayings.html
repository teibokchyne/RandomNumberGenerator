<h1>Sayings to keep in mind</h1>
<button class="button" >Stability is a lie, an illusion created by the brain and enforced by the rulers of human society to make you a work-slave else you'll lose your so-called stable job and stable life. The only thing you can keep stable in your life is your internal stability, you cannot control external stability. The only constant is change and things change everyday.</button></br>
<button class="button" >You have a subconscious competitiveness and hostility towards those with more capability, power, authority, seniority, etc. than you and thus makes you subconsciously reveal it in your words even when you consciously don't want to be hostile towards them. Categorise people into green, blue, azure, yin-yang, yellow, orange, and red depending on your relationship and how you perceive them to prevent your subconscious bias.</button></br>
<button class="button" >The spirit is like the body. It needs rest, exercise and food. Treat it as you would your body. Maintain its health.</button></br>
<button class="button" >There are many things mediocre people have that extraordinary people are envious of but each have made their choice.</button></br>
<button class="button" >Entertainment and distraction is the enemy of creation and learning. They will keep you in mediocrity.</button></br>
